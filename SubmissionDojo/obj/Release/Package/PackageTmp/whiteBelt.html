White belt is the first belt within Brazilian jiu-jitsu. 
The rank is held by any practitioner new to the art and has no prerequisite. 
Some instructors and other high-level practitioners think that a white belt's training should emphasize escapes and defensive positioning since a white belt will often fight from inferior positions, especially when training with more experienced practitioners.
Most academies will additionally require that a white belt level practitioner works to obtain a well-rounded skills set, with a knowledge of basic offensive moves, such as common submissions and guard passes.</p>
