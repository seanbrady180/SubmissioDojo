    Blue belt is most often the second adult rank in the Brazilian jiu-jitsu. 
    At the blue belt level, students gain a wide breadth of technical knowledge and undertake hundreds of hours of mat-time to learn how to implement these moves efficiently. 
    Blue belt is often the rank at which the student learns a large number of techniques.

    Not all Brazilian jiu-jitsu schools or regulatory bodies award the blue belt as the second adult belt.
    Although many Brazilian jiu-jitsu organizations adhere to the IBJJF standard of awarding the yellow, orange, and green belt exclusively as part of a youth belt system (under 16 years of age), 
    some supplement the time between white belt and blue belt with one or more belts of these colors.

    The IBJJF requires that a practitioner be at least 16 years old to receive a blue belt, thereby officially entering into the adult belt system.</p>
